**Project Part 3 Objective 3 Description**

The feature that we have implemented for our website is the functionality of both creating teams and joining teams.

Each logged in member will have the chance to create a single team. During the process of creating a team, the user

will be able to choose their respective sport, number of desired teamates and their team name. After creating the 

team, the "Join a Team" page will now display all of the teams that are joinable. Other users will be able to 

navigate to this page and join a team that fits their needs. If there is already too many players on the team,

the user will not be able to join. This objective worked heavily with the relationships between several SQL tables. 

We created primary keys to identify each user and their respective team. Additionally, the objective involved 

the creation of more complex forms and Jinja2 to correctly format and display the teams.
